# STM8S-examples
Examples found on the Internet for using the resources of the STM8 since the ST does not seem to support this line of low cost microcontrollers very well.

![The STM8S003 is almost identical to the STM8S103, the only difference is a smaller EEPROM area:](https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino/issues/90)

STM8S003F3: https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8s003f3.html
- Data memory: 128 bytes true data EEPROM; endurance up to 100 k write/erase cycles 

STM8S103F3: https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8s103f3.html
- Data memory: 640 byte true data EEPROM; endurance 300 kcycle
